## üéØ The Problem
Northeastern University students seeking to use the Marino Recreation Center faced a significant challenge: information about court schedules, group fitness classes, and facility availability was scattered across multiple university websites. This data was often presented in inconsistent formats, making it difficult for students to get a clear, up-to-date picture of what was happening at the gym. Planning a workout, joining a pickup game, or finding an open court was a frustrating and time-consuming process.

## ‚ú® The Solution
The Marino Center Schedule is a web application that solves this problem by consolidating all relevant data into a single, user-friendly interface. By integrating with multiple university API endpoints, this tool provides a clear, accessible, and unified view of all gym events and facility capacities.

This project transforms a scattered and confusing dataset into a streamlined and intuitive tool, significantly improving student access to gym facilities and information. In its first month, the application successfully **served over 100 users**, demonstrating a clear demand for a centralized scheduling solution.
